Welcome user.

The following project to a fictional landing page for a heavy goods transport vehicle. While the vehicle itself, the Nasa crawler is real the use advertised on the page is not. The page will be used to promote the use of the crawler and possibly sell other products to potential buyers. 

The page will include a title a sub heading with the company motto. 
Below this will have a picture with the company mission statement which also outlines the geopolitical problem which product is being used for subvert. 

Below will be a mission statement section containing two buttons, one leading to a booking form and one leading to pictures of additional models for a customer to buy. 

Below this will be a section of images of the products available. 






The top of the page begins with the standard emmit boiler plate code. The head contains links to

Buttons added to promote the services of selling and booking rides on the crawler. 

I've added mission statement paragraphs setting out the clients problem, and offering the service to solve it.

I have added images of the products available to buy on the site in the images section. 
changed the color of the nav bar. I cannot seem to get a consistant layout. The navbar covers the whole width of the page, other elements do not. 
I need to move the background image down to frame the header text in the top of the screen, but have only srunk the navbar thus far.
