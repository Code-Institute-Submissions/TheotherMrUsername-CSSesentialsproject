Structure 

I wanted to create a simple landing page with 



Mission statement page: This part would outline the problem which the product is trying to address and sell the service to a potential customer. 

Booking and Buying Section: This gave quick access to the booking section or the buying section for new and returning customers. 

Stock section: This would give users the ability to browse pictures of available models. 


Colour. 

The navbar and mission statement sections are coloured to complement the background picture on which greats the user when the page first loads with the headers having darker theme to contrast these coulors. 

The additional sections were styled to be consistent with this theme with a dark blue being used to represent the ocean which the site the service is trying to connect the user to. 


Color Palette. 

Langauge:

After estabilising the name of the service in the navbar and the additional product infromation in the opening header, the secondary header tries to highten the users interest with an open statement to draw them in. 

I tried to quickly establish the purpose of the service and the method it uses in small pieces of dialof so as not overwhelm the user.
