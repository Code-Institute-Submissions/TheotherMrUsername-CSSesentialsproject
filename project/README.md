User Stories. 

As a buiness owner, I want to build awereness of the service and promote the business. 

As a business owner, I want to promte the booking service to new and returning customers and lead returning customers to the option to buy the product. 

As a business owner I want the customer to have easy access to a booking site which is simple to use.

As a user I want a website with simple chioces delivered easily. 

As a user I would like to access to site regardless of the device I am using. 

As a user I want the option of browsing stock and gaining access to additonal information regarding the service. 

Structure 

I wanted to create a landing page with easy to find buttons leading to booking and buying services, with additional information for customers further down. 


Navbar: This provided the user with the company name and links to other pages of the site. 

Booking and Buying Section: This gave quick access to the booking section or the buying section for new and returning customers. 

Mission statement page: This part would outline the problem which the product is trying to address and sell the service to a potential customer. 

Stock section: This would give users the ability to browse pictures of available models to be purchased. . 


Colour. 

The navbar and mission statement sections are coloured to complement the background picture on which greets the user when the page first loads with the headers having darker theme to contrast these colours. 

The additional sections were styled to be consistent with this theme with a dark blue being used to represent the ocean which the site the service is trying to connect the user to. 

I have used a background colour for some of the text to set it apart from the background image. 


Langauge:

After estabilising the name of the service in the navbar and the additional product infromation in the opening header, the secondary header tries to highten the users interest with an open statement to draw them in. 

I tried to quickly establish the purpose of the service and the method it uses in small pieces of dialof so as not overwhelm the user.
